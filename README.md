# SevOmatic

This application aims to take the contents of a json file and insert it into a Google spreadsheet.

In order to obtain access to a users Google spreadsheet; specific access has to be obtained by Google both for running the application and for allowing the application to modify a spreadsheet on behalf of a user.

For now, a test json file is used to update the spreadsheet (\SevOmatic\SevOmatic.Terminal\testdata.json).

Until I receive the proper format to be used, the test file format can't be changed. You can however modify/add/remove items in the testdata.json test file as long as the format stays the same.

## First Run Setup instructions
Tools needed
- .net core 5 SDK https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0
- A git client (Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/)

##### 1. Download repository
- Open a terminal (Cmd/Powershell/Bash)
- Create a folder and enter it
- Type "git clone https://github.com/bar10dr/SevOmatic.git" or use another git client to download the source from github

##### 2. Creating the Google application credentials
This step will register an application at Google and give you a json file containing the credentials for your registered application.
- Go to https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/dotnet
- Press the blue button named "Enable the Google Sheets API"
- Enter a name for the application and press next
- Choose "Desktop app" in the dropdown and press "Create"
- Press the "Download client configuration" and save the "credentials.json" file to the "\SevOmatic\SevOmatic.Terminal\" folder

##### 3. Giving the application rights to modify your Google Spreadsheets
This step will grant the application you just created the rights to modify your Google user's spreadsheet data.
- Open Command Line (cmd/Powershell/Linux console)
- Go to the "\SevOmatic\SevOmatic.Terminal\" folder
- Type "dotnet run", this will start the application
- It will open a browser window to Googles authentication page
- Choose the account of the user who's Spreadsheets account you want to use
- Since the Application has not been verified by Google, press the "Advanced" link
- Press the "Go to <whatever name you gave your application>" link
- Press the "Allow" link
- Press the "Allow" button

##### 4. Setup finished
The application should now create a new spreadsheet, and continually update it.

Going to the "\SevOmatic\SevOmatic.Terminal\" folder and typing "dotnet run" will now start the application without any other input required from here on out.

The Google Application and User credentials are saved to file in the local project folder and can be copied if you ever need to move the application to another machine.

When the github source code is updated, just go to the root "\SevOmatic\" folder and type "git pull" and it will update the local files automatically with the new changes (If using the CLI GIT specified above).

## Usage instructions
The application will only modify the first worksheet of a spreadsheet, so additional spreadsheets may be modified at will.

The application refers to the spreadsheet ID, so you are free to change the spreadsheet name or location at will.

The application will run fine without any command line arguments, but some are implemented for convenience.

To use arguments with the "dotnet run" command, you have to add two -- after the command before initiating arguments.

_`Ex: dotnet run -- -e false -r single -f 30 -x 3`_

---

#### Specify what row in the spreadsheet to start inserting information

The first row of the worksheet to start inserting information on.

This way you can customize the top of a spreadsheet manually. Default is 1.

-x [Row number]

_`Ex: dotnet run -- -x 3`_


#### Run mode

Dictates if the application should run just once or keep running.

This way you can elect to use Windows Task Scheduler or Linux crontab instead of having the application running constantly.

Single = will run once and quit.

Continous = Will keep running until manually stopped. Continous is on by default.

-r [single/continous]

_`Ex: dotnet run -- -r single`_


#### Update frequency

If in continous mode, will set the number of seconds between each attempt to update the spreadsheet. Default is 60.

-f [Update frequency]

_`Ex: dotnet run -- -f 30`_


#### _Show detailed error information_

Shows the full error in the console should the application crash. Disabled by default as it might show personal Google information.

-e [false/true]

_`Ex: dotnet run -- -e true`_


#### Show log in console window

Shows log in the console window, turning this off will stop any text being output to the console. Enabled by default.

-l [false/true]

_`Ex: dotnet run -- -l false`_
